# Terminal (Browser)

> The Browser Terminal is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) Â· [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/17724).

The Browser Terminal is a standalone IDE option built with the same technologies powering VS Code's terminals.

## Accessing tasks

If you have pre-defined tasks in your `.gitpod.yml`, they will not appear right away as separate terminals like in JetBrains IDEs or VS Code. You can interface with tasks using [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks).

## Accessing ports

Similar to tasks, you may want to open different ports' URLs. You can do that with [`gp preview`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#preview).

> **Note**:ðŸ’¡ `gp preview` and `gp preview --external` have the same effect with the Browser Terminal, because split-view is not available there.
