# OpenID Connect (OIDC) in Gitpod

You can use OIDC authentication to connect Gitpod workspaces to cloud providers or third parties such as: AWS, Azure, GCP, or secret management services like Vault. Use of OIDC integration eliminates the need to manually distribute access credentials, secrets and other key material via other methods such as environment variables.

## What is OIDC?

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the [OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/), which allows clients to verify identity.

OIDC leverages use of a JWT, a security token that allows the client to verify the identity of the caller. The token is a <abbr title="JSON Web Token">JWT</abbr> that contains claims about the caller. Claims are statements about a caller and can contain information such as a name, email address or repository metadata.

OIDC provides a reliable way to establish a user's identity, including the ability to authenticate them and get their basic profile information. It gives third-party applications a standardized, secure, and scalable method to authenticate and authorize users. When used in combination with Gitpod, it helps in automating the secure access to 3rd-party services that your workspaces might need to interact with.

## Setting up OIDC Authentication with a third party

Setting up OIDC Authentication generally involves three main steps:

1. **Establish Trust**: You first need to register Gitpod with your OIDC-supported third party (like AWS, Google, etc.). This third party then becomes the audience in your JWT token generated in Gitpod.

1. **Setup Trust Rules**: The 3rd party usually allows you to configure what the configuration of the JWT claims must be to exchanged for a valid auth token. Here you can implement fine-grained controls over what access is granted.

1. **Exchange the JWT token**: Once both trust and trust rules have been established with the third party, you can use the JWT tokens generated by the `gp idp token` command to authorize JWT tokens to the third party.

## Gitpod CLI integration

You can retrieve a JWT token for OIDC using `gp idp`. To retrieve the OIDC token for the current workspace run `gp idp token`.

For example, to request a new OIDC JWT for `example.org` you'll need to execute `gp idp token --audience example.org`, the output of which you can use to authenticate yourself.

### Example usage

```bash
$ gp idp token --audience example.org
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImlkLTE2ODQ3NTc4MDY...
```

The output, when decoded, translates to a JSON object similar to the one below.

```json
{
  "aud": ["example.org"],
  "auth_time": 1684777794,
  "azp": "example.org",
  "c_hash": "gc_vPbUNoCT0UmXDCdp1sw",
  "email": "kumquat@gitpod.io",
  "email_verified": true,
  "exp": 1684781394,
  "iat": 1684777794,
  "iss": "https://api.gitpod.io/idp",
  "name": "Kumquat The Third",
  "sub": "https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/pull/1"
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Important**: `email_verified` is only true if you are signed in to Gitpod via an SSO provider. If you're only signed in with an <abbr title="Source Code Management">SCM</abbr> authentication provider, this field will be `false`.
