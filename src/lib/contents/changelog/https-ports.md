In Gitpod, you can now expose ports from your workspace running with HTTPS.

Previously, HTTPS ports exposed in a workspace would show a "port not found" page when accessed. You can configure the port protocol either in your [gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) or via the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli).

## Configuring a port protocol in `.gitpod.yml`

To ensure a port is always configured with a specific protocol you can update the `ports` definition block in `.gitpod.yml` as below. Updating your `.gitpod.yml` is the preferred approach to using the `gp` CLI (see below), as the `.gitpod.yml` is declarative and ensures workspaces are created repeatably.

```yml
ports:
  - name: Frontend Application
    port: 3000
    protocol: https
```

## Dynamically updating port protocols with `gp`

You can dynamically change the protocol of a port using the `gp ports protocol` command.

For example, `gp ports protocol 3000:https` will change port `3000` to use `https`.

Or, `gp ports protocol 3000:http` will change port `3000` to use `http`. By default, ports are set as HTTP.

See [configuring ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports), [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) [gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.
