Beginning today, you can use the Browser Terminal as a lightweight alternative editor for quick edits and git operations or for use with terminal-based editors such as Vim, Emacs or Nano.

You can start using the Browser Terminal right away: either by selecting it in the `New Workspace` modal for one-time use or by choosing it in your [User Preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/preferences) to use it as your preferred default.
